Raspberry Pi Gamepad - Linux Service connecting 2x USB HID Mice into 1x XAC Virtual Joystick for Windows

Ever wanted to use 2 Mice instead of the usual Keyboard and Mouse to play PC games? \
Well now you can! All that's required is a correctly configured Raspberry Pi 4. \
(other models of Pi may work with some tweaking and are as yet untested)
