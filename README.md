Raspberry Pi Gamepad - Linux Service connecting 2x USB HID Mice into 1x XAC Virtual Joystick for Windows

Ever wanted to use 2 Mice instead of the usual Keyboard and Mouse to play PC games? \
Well now you can! All that's required is a correctly configured Raspberry Pi 4. \
(other models of Pi may work with some tweaking and are as yet untested)

To Install, use `git clone` to create a local copy of the repository (or download as .zip) \
and use `make install`. Feel free to customise the Makefile and Service to find what works.
